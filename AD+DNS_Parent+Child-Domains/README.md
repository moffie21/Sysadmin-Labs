# Active Directory and DNS - Parent and Child Domains
## INTENTION
For educational purposes showcasing my technical systema and network administrator abilities.
  
## WHAT'S THIS?
Built and configured a logical topology of a multi-city organization featuring ASA and IPsec VPN routing protocols in VMware Workstation Pro 25H2 lab environment.
  
## GOALS - Proof Config Implementation Worked Successfully
- Allow DMZ devices to ping LA devices.
- Successfully have each L3 device, except ISP; SF; and MI, learn single-area OSPF routes.
- Successfully SSH from a L2 or L3 device to: LA_3650_DMZ, LA_3650, and ISP_3650_R devices.

## TOOLS
- Type 2 hypervisor: VMware Workstation Pro 25H2
  - Lab environment: GNS3 v2.2.56.1
    - Device:
        - L3 Cisco 2911 router => Cisco IOSv 15.9(3)M2
        - Cisco 5506 => Cisco ASAv 9.22.1.1-1
        - L3/L2 Cisco 3650 switch => Cisco IOSv-L2
        - L2 Cisco 2960 switch => Cisco IOSv-L2
        - Servers and PC hosts => VPC
    - Console application: Solar-PuTTY
  
## PROTOCOLS IMPLEMENTED - What I Scripted
- Subnet one /8 organization into 5 /16 city branches (LA, SD, SF, NY, MI) down to /30 subnets
- VLANs
  - VLAN 10 "Management" /25
  - VLAN 20 "Server" /23 (LA only)
  - VLAN 30 "IT" /23 (LA only)
  - VLAN 40 "Users" /20
  - VLAN 50 "Wireless" /19
  - VLAN 250 /29 (LA only)
- VTP (Server/Client, domain, password)
- Trunking
- Inter-VLAN routing
- NAT (PAT), static to LA_3650_DMZ, static to LA_3650
- ASA Hub-and-Spoke, ASA Failover
- Site-to-Site IPsec VPN (LA and NY, LA and SD, SD and SF, NY and MI)
- OSPF (single-area) (not for ISP_3650_R, FW_SF_R, FW_MI_R)
- Basic Security and SSH (from the Internet to LA_3650_DMZ, LA_3650)
  
## CHALLENGES / LESSON(S) LEARNED
- Challenge: Getting NAT and all the ACLs correct so they don't interfere with other protocols.
- LL: It was fun and concise to create network objects.
- LL: Configuring NAT exemption ACLs to ensure specific traffic would route through the IPsec tunnels.
- LL: OSPF single-area only outputted for each private network to learn about its own subnets vs all private networks learning about all other private networks.
- LL: Configuring ASA Failover was easier than I initially thought.
